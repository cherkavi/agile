# my own improvements for Scrum/LeSS/XP

## Context
Whole team after planning2 and splitting up all UserStories on tasks don't have clear vision what should be done and how to start one ( or even more ) of them ( US )

## Decision
Using technique "Measurement of understability" to detect not clear stories and work on it ( them ) again and again

## Consequences
* decrease likelihood of defects ( increase quality )
* decrease delays ( task switching, information exchange )
